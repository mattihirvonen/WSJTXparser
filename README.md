
Parse WSJT-X application's "ALL.TXT" log file. Count heard stations.
Count resolution is:

  - call sign
  - mode (FT8, FT4, etc...)
  - band info

Current hardware installation do not have CAT control to radio.
So "band info" is same as WSJT-X application's default frequency value per band

This source code is tested to build in

  - windows 7
  - CodeBlocks 17.12
  - MinGW compiler environment (included in CodeBlocks installation)
